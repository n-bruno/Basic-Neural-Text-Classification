# Basic Neural Text Classification

## About
This project is a WIP. This Python project demonstrates basic neural text classification with a 4-layered neural network. I followed [Tech with Tim's tutorial](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-neural-networks/text-classification-p1/), with modications.

## Requirements
None. The Python code accesses the IMDB dataset through the [Keras API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras]). The exact details are located on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification).
